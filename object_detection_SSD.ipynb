Faster R-CNN uses a region proposal network to create boundary boxes and utilizes those boxes to classify objects. While it is considered the state-of-the-art in accuracy, the whole process runs at 7 frames per second. Far below what a real-time processing needs. SSD speeds up the process by eliminating the need of the region proposal network. To recover the drop in accuracy, SSD applies a few improvements including multi-scale features and default boxes. These improvements allow SSD to match the Faster R-CNN’s accuracy using lower resolution images, which further pushes the speed higher. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fdsM7u5tIf-p","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Single Shot MultiBox Detector for real-time processing\n","The SSD object detection composes of 2 parts\n","\n","-->Extract feature maps, and\n","\n","-->Apply convolution filters to detect objects.\n","\n","### Extract feature maps\n","\n","SSD uses VGG16 to extract feature maps. Then it detects objects using the Conv4_3 layer. For illustration, we draw the Conv4_3 to be 8 × 8 spatially (it should be 38 × 38). For each cell (also called location), it makes 4 object predictions.\n","\n","### Convolutional predictors for object detection\n","\n","SSD does not use a delegated region proposal network. Instead, it resolves to a very simple method. It computes both the location and class scores using small convolution filters. After extracting the feature maps, SSD applies 3 × 3 convolution filters for each cell to make predictions. (These filters compute the results just like the regular CNN filters.) Each filter outputs 25 channels: 21 scores for each class plus one boundary box."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"kFSqkTCdWKMI"},"source":["# Imports"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"hV4P5gyTWKMI","colab":{},"outputId":"470e6a52-b0df-4fc5-e53a-543e5088c38f"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import os\n","import six.moves.urllib as urllib\n","import sys\n","import tarfile\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import zipfile\n","\n","from distutils.version import StrictVersion\n","from collections import defaultdict\n","from io import StringIO\n","from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n","from PIL import Image\n","\n","# This is needed since the notebook is stored in the object_detection folder.\n","sys.path.append(\"..\")\n","from object_detection.utils import ops as utils_ops\n","\n","if StrictVersion(tf.__version__) < StrictVersion('1.12.0'):\n","  raise ImportError('Please upgrade your TensorFlow installation to v1.12.*.')\n","import cv2\n","\n","cap = cv2.VideoCapture('2.mp4')\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/home/murthy/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/h5py/__init__.py:36: FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `float` to `np.floating` is deprecated.
